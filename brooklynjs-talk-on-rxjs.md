##Talk Proposal by Sean Reed: Using simple games to learn RxJS
So, as part of my monthly-ish [Basic Javascript Games](https://www.meetup.com/Basic-Javascript-Games/events/234094801/) meetup group we coded a game called Grasshopper. I did my first implementation of the game in vanilla JS. Since I'd been reading and watching videos about RxJS, and since the game itself is super short, I decided to see if I could do an implementation as a first-time newbie RxJS user. I can't promise that my code is idiomatic, but I'd love to do a short talk about mind-bendy-ness of the more functional RxJS implementation and contrast the plain vanilla and RxJS approaches I used.
